## Last Completed (evening session 2026-04-18)

### TASK-043 Phase 2 — Mac Mini process audit script shipped
- `scripts/audit_mac_mini.py` fully operational: Phase 1 dry-run, Phase 2 SIGTERM kills, Phase 3 CPU baseline
- Fixed `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` env var name (was `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`); added `dotenv` auto-load for standalone use
- Phase 2 cleared 5 orphaned pytest workers (test_queue_stall_detector, 4+ days stale, ~180% CPU freed)
- Phase 3 baseline running in background (PID 55042, verdict auto-posts to agent_messages ~22:15 SGT)
- Commit: `b33db53`

### BUG-022 — agent_messages claim/lock pattern (CC-2 prerequisite)
- `claimed_by TEXT` + `claimed_at TIMESTAMPTZ` added to `agent_messages` in orchestrator Supabase
- `idx_agent_messages_claim` index + `agent_message_stale_claims` view (stale = >15 min old with `responded_at IS NULL`)
- Claim pattern: atomic `UPDATE WHERE claimed_by IS NULL RETURNING *` — 0 rows = lost race
- Verified end-to-end via Python: first claim wins, second returns 0 rows, release works
- CC-2 launch now safe: `CC_AGENT_ID=cc-ihsanos-2 ~/wingmen/orchestrator/scripts/launch_dangerous_cc.sh`

### BUG-023 — pytest-timeout enforcement (hung-test orphan prevention)
- `pytest-timeout==2.4.0` added to `requirements.txt`
- `pytest.ini`: `timeout = 60`, `timeout_method = thread` (asyncio-safe)
- `@pytest.mark.timeout(10)` added to `test_recovery_clears_dedup` (the test that spawned the zombies)
- Commit: `aea4ce2` (pushed)

### TASK-044 and ARCH-033 — reviews posted to CAI
- TASK-044: daily 08:00 SGT cron, allowlist seeded, polling self-deprecation, 24h Telegram escalation
- ARCH-033: Tier 2 optimistic-lock checks, pre-commit runner, repo-specific prompts, bypass allowlist
